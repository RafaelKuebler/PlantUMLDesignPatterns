    <b><color:royalBlue>Chain of Responsibility</color></b>
    <b>Type:</b> Behavioral
    Avoid coupling the sender of a request to
    its receiver by giving more than one object
    a chance to handle the request. Chain the
    receiving objects and pass the request
    along the chain until an object handles it.
